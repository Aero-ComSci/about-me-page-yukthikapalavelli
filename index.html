   <u> <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 2, 79); font-style: oblique; font-size: 12;">Career Goals:</h2></u>
    <p2 style="color: black;font-size: 12 ; font-style: oblique;">
         I have always thought something was interesting behind coding and I always wondered how computers calculated so fast and how websites were created so advancedly. When I figured that coding was involved with some sort of magic, I wanted to learn more about it. As a girl, I know that women did not get a lot of motivation, but I was able to from my family who have majored in this degree. After experimenting with coding, I realized how unique and fun it is. You can explore and discover so many different things hidden behind these electronic devices, things that we use now in the real world constantly. Learning more about computer science is allowing me to grow and get more information about coding to help me in the near future.

  <u><h2 style="color: rgb(35, 2, 79); font-style: oblique; font-size: 12;"> Strengths, Personal Qualities, Abiltiies, Skills, and Achievements:</h2></u>
    <p3 style="color: black;font-size: 12; font-style: oblique;"> The characteristics I possess can really help in the field of computer science and my career. One characteristic includes persistence. Now why does that matter? Having the characteristic of persistence can allow me to strive and continue through the obstacles that follow me. I would have a more positive mindset and this can benefit the way I succeed in this field. Another important characteristic is my ability for responsibility. If I am given a task, I never like to postpone it and like getting it done on time. Because of this quality, when I am working in an environment that is tight and given a lot of work, I can get the work done on time and manage my time well for other tasks. Lastly, I am creative. My creativity can be very useful, especially in this field, to help put out ideas to better develop a code. My creativity can also be used for the user interface design which can help the audience be appealed to and attracted. In my high school journey so far, I have joined the Computer Science Essential class and I've finally learned how to create a website all off of coding. This class allowed me to learn the different fundaments and concepts to help me create a product involved with coding. Other accomplishments in this class include creating different types of games and creating a user interface. </p3>
  <u> <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 2, 79); font-style: oblique; font-size:12;"> Conclusion: </h2></u>
    <p5 style="color: black;font-size: 12; font-style: oblique;"> With exploration, experience, and learning, I think coding is the way to go for me. I love the way people think about technology and the different ways we can use it to create phenomenal outputs. I want to continue in the field of computer science and think deeper to create complex solutions in the world of technology for the benefit of my future and the society around me. Thank you so much for visiting my About Me page and getting to know a little bit about me. If you are interested, you may explore the rest of my site to get to know some more facts and once again, thank you. </p5>
